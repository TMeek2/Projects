# Projects
#
# This "Projects" folder holds some of the more intricate programs that I have written. Most of these were written in Java while some are in Python.  Some of these programs were written early in my programming career. Since then I have greatly developed as a programmer and that can clearly be seen as you view these programs. Some of my more recent programs are "AddressBook", "FileEdittor", and "TicTacToe".
